Innovators with contrarian perspectives, like the Wright Brothers, often struggle to commercialize their ideas due to skepticism. They must first convince others of their approach's validity. This study tests the hypothesis that public demonstrations can pave the way for contrarian entrepreneurship. Focusing on academic founders of AI startups, I analyze data from hundreds of competitions held between 2000 and 2022. These competitions, which pit different methods against each other, help clarify effective approaches. My findings show that winners of these competitions are significantly more likely to start a startup soon after their victory compared to runners-up. Importantly, this effect is particularly pronounced for contrarian winners, whose methods were initially less popular and lagging behind the state-of-the-art. This demonstrates that public validation through competitions is crucial for encouraging contrarian entrepreneurship.
