title: "Measuring welfare losses in markets for ideas: Evidence from Digital Startups Auctions"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/marketforideas-welfare
excerpt: 'Many studies have shown that information frictions make ideas hard to sell. However, due to a lack of pricing data, most of these studies have focused on the impact of frictions on the likelihood of selling ideas rather than on the welfare losses from missed transactions.
First, I lay out a theoretical framework that highlights why this distinction matters. If the best ideas are the hardest to sell and the idea distribution is skewed, the proportion of welfare lost might far surpass the proportion of ideas unsold because of frictions.
Next, I demonstrate that this distinction is significant in practice by examining online auctions for digital startups. I leverage the fact that informational frictions are less severe for advertising startups, whose revenues can be verified by the marketplace. I find that advertising startups are "only" 6.3% more likely to sell but elicit prices that are 2.7 times higher. Simulations show that moving from universal access to a complete absence of revenue verification reduces gains from trade by 47%, driven by the concentration of gains among a few ideas. These results suggest that analyzing the impact of informational frictions solely on the probability of selling an idea can significantly underestimate the magnitude of the problem.'
