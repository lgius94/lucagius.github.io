excerpt: "Coauthored with Mercedes Delgado.

The number of multi-location patents (i.e., team of U.S. co-inventors located in multiple
cities) has increased sharply in the last 20 years in the U.S. economy, representing 50% of all team
patents by 2020. We investigate whether the growing geographical dispersion of teams creates
frictions that vary by gender. We hypothesize that female inventors are more geographically
constrained than men (i.e., higher cost of temporary proximity by travelling), and these frictions
might affect who female inventors collaborate with. We show that female inventors are more
collocated (same-city) with the team of co-inventors than male inventors. This is the case for both
new inventors (first patent) and experienced ones. The Female-versus-Male inventor gap in team
collocation increases with age. Women are less collocated than men while having low likelihood
of having children (age below 32), but women team collocation increases afterwards and become
more collocated than men. In contrast, male inventorsâ€™ team collocation decreases continuously
with age. We find preliminary evidence that the increase in gender gap collocation with age is
driven by an earlier exit (stop patenting) of women who, early in their inventor career, worked in
multi-location patents. Overall, these findings are consistent with women facing higher relative
constrains later on in their careers when they might have more family obligations. Finally, the
location of inventors in top technology clusters help reduce these constraints since the degree of
team collocation is much higher for inventors in these clusters. Our findings offer important
insights for the work-from-anywhere debate."
